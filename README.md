# Bus Docking Simulation

This Python script simulates the path of a bus performing a docking manoeuvre near a curb. It models the vehicle's motion using a simplified turning radius and visualises the trajectory with an animated plot.

## Features
- Simulates a bus turning along a circular arc
- Visualises the swept path and front axle position
- Adjustable parameters for wheelbase, track width, and turn radius

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
