# Bus Docking Simulation

This Python script simulates the path of a bus performing a docking manoeuvre near a curb. Data collected from this can then be used to design curbs, ensuring passengers do not stand in the path of the area the front of the bus will sweep over. It models the vehicle's motion using a simplified turning radius and visualises the trajectory with an animated plot.

Created as part of a UCL colleague's PhD thesis on public transport accessibility. 

Key words: Accessibility, public transport, dynamic simulation

## Features
- Simulates a bus turning along a circular arc
- Visualises the swept path and front axle position
- Adjustable parameters for wheelbase, track width, and turn radius

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
